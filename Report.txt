Based on the results I achieved by timing the code for BookIndexSplay and BookIndexCreator,
the splay tree is faster than the binary search tree for files where access of the same node
occurs frequently. In the challenge.txt that I wrote, there were several lines that
were specially designed favor the Splay tree over the standard binary search tree. These lines
are those that are repeated or values that were closely clustered together. This would provide
a greater benefit to a splay tree because a splay tree modifies itself in order to accomodate
nodes that are frequently accessed. It pushes nodes that are accessed more frequently
(and anything around those nodes) towards the top so that the number of steps to find the node
in the tree is less. The timings for each the splay tree and the Binary Search tree can be seen
in the code (they are printed out). The timings for the BST are 22947083 nanoseconds and 18477053 
nanoseconds for the splay tree.
